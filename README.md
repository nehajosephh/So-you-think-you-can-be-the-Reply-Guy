# **So You Think You Can Be the Reply Guy**
### *A Chrome extension that makes sure you never leave X before fulfilling your sacred duty: replying to strangers.*


## 👀 What is this?

**So You Think You Can Be the Reply Guy** is a chaotic productivity tool disguised as a Chrome extension.

It counts how many **replies** you make on X (Twitter) and warns you with a browser “Are you sure?” dialog — packed with unhinged Reply Guy roast lines — if you attempt to leave the site before reaching your self-imposed quota.

If you’ve ever wanted a browser extension to:

- bully you into replying more,  
- shame you for leaving too early,  
- track your ratio like your life depends on it,  
- and spiritually transform you into That Guy™…

Then congratulations. You’ve found your calling.


## ✨ Features

- ✔️ **Counts your actual replies** (by detecting the “Replying to” interface on X)  
- ✔️ **Custom daily reply quota**  
- ✔️ **Warning block** with roast message when you try to leave  
- ✔️ **Random Reply Guy quotes**  
- ✔️ **Badge counter** showing progress  
- ✔️ **Options page** to adjust quota or reset count  
- ✔️ Works on **https://x.com** and **https://twitter.com**


## 😂 Sample “Reply Guy” Roast Lines

> *“Bro… you’re really gonna leave BEFORE replying? Tragic.”*

> *“Ratio alert: you’re behind on replies.”*

> *“Hold up king/queen, the timeline still needs you.”*

> *“Oh wow, leaving already? Couldn’t be me.”*

It's like having your own personal hype man — if he was significantly more annoying.
